### Q. Do I need prior AI, backend, or university-domain knowledge?

No ❌  
You do **not** need prior AI or university system experience.

- Beginners can work on UI components, documentation, and styling
- Intermediate contributors can handle logic, validation, and dashboards
- Advanced contributors can work on optimization logic and architecture

Clear guidance and reviews will be provided.

---

### Q. Is UniFlux a frontend-only or full-stack project?

UniFlux follows a **frontend + backend architecture**.

- 🖥️ **Frontend**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- 🔐 **Backend**: Handles authentication, data storage, scheduling rules, and results

Some features may initially run with mock or in-memory data during early phases.

---

### Q. Why don’t I see real data in the dashboard yet?

During early ECWOC 2026 phases, some modules may use:

- Mock data
- Temporary in-memory state

This is intentional and helps contributors focus on UI and logic first.  
Full database integration will be introduced in later milestones.

---

### Q. Where is academic data (timetables, results, users) stored?

- 🔧 During development: temporary state or local environment
- 🚀 Final version: securely stored in a database via the backend

Sensitive data will **never** be exposed on the frontend.

---

### Q. How will authentication work?

UniFlux uses **role-based authentication**:

- University Admin
- Department Admin
- Faculty

Access to pages and actions is strictly controlled based on role permissions.

---

### Q. Is there a Discord or community channel?

Yes 💬  
A **Discord server link will be shared later** once the project reaches a stable phase during ECWOC 2026.

---

### Q. Can I work on multiple issues at the same time?

To ensure fairness and quality:

- Contributors are encouraged to work on **one issue at a time**
- You may request a new issue after submitting or completing your current PR

---

### Q. What happens if my PR is not accepted?

That’s okay 💙  
You will receive **clear feedback** explaining what needs improvement.  
You can update your PR and resubmit—learning is part of open source!
