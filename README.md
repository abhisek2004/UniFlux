# 📐 Architecture Diagram

UniFlux follows a **clean, scalable frontend–backend architecture** designed for real-world university systems.

    A[Users: Admin, Department, Faculty]
    B[Frontend: TypeScript & Tailwind CSS]
    C[Backend API: Node.js & Express]
    D[Database: MongoDB Atlas]

    A --> B
    B -->|REST API Requests| C
    C -->|CRUD Operations| D
    D -->|Query Results| C
    C -->|JSON Responses| B
```

---

### 🧩 Architecture Highlights

* Clear **separation of concerns**
* Secure **role-based access**
* Scalable for **multi-department universities**
* Open-source friendly structure

---

# 🔄 Data Flow Chart

This shows how data moves through UniFlux during a **typical authenticated workflow**.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant B as Backend
    participant D as Database

    U->>F: Login / Request Data
    F->>B: API Request (with credentials/token)
    B->>D: Fetch / Store Academic Data
    D-->>B: Data Response
    B-->>F: Authorized JSON Response
    F-->>U: UI Update (Dashboard / Timetable)
```

### 📌 Key Flow Principles

* Frontend never accesses database directly
* Backend enforces **authorization & validation**
* All sensitive logic stays on the server

# 📦 Module-Wise Tech Mapping

| Module             | Responsibility                   | Tech Used                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Authentication     | Login, roles, protected routes   | JWT, Express Middleware  |
| User Management    | Admin, Dept Admin, Faculty roles | Node.js, MongoDB         |
| Timetable Input    | Subjects, faculty, rooms, slots  | TypeScript, Tailwind     |
| Timetable Engine   | Schedule generation & checks     | Rule-based JS logic      |
| Conflict Detection | Clash identification             | Backend validation logic |
| Rearrangement      | Alternate slot suggestions       | Constraint logic         |
| Dashboards         | Workload & utilization views     | Chart.js / JS Charts     |
| Result Management  | SGPA / CGPA processing           | Backend logic            |
| API Layer          | Data exchange                    | REST APIs                |
| Deployment         | Hosting & CI                     | Vercel, Render           |

# 🧠 Optimization Logic Explanation

UniFlux uses a **rule-based optimization approach** (easy to understand, extend, and open-source friendly).

### 🎯 Core Constraints Considered

* Faculty availability
* Classroom & lab capacity
* Subject credit requirements
* Max classes per day/week
* Fixed slots (labs, seminars)
* Multi-department overlaps

---

### ⚙️ Optimization Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Collect Input Data] --> B[Apply Fixed Constraints]
    B --> C[Check Faculty Availability]
    C --> D[Check Room Availability]
    D --> E[Detect Conflicts]
    E -->|No Conflicts| F[Generate Timetable]
    E -->|Conflicts Found| G[Suggest Alternate Slots]
    G --> F
```

---

### ✅ Why Rule-Based (Instead of Heavy AI)?

* Transparent & explainable logic
* Easier for contributors to understand
* Faster to debug
* Can later be upgraded to AI/ML models

---

### 🔮 Future Enhancement Path

* AI-assisted preference learning
* Predictive faculty availability
* Optimization scoring system
* Genetic / heuristic algorithms
